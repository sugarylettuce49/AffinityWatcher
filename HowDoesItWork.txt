These scripts are designed to Disable Thread/CPU 0 and 1 for:
Medal and its encoder processes.
OBS and it's encoder processes.
Chrome
Discord
Spotify
SteamWebHelper (the part of Steam that displays stuff, as Steam itself needs all threads enabled, otherwise games started by it will also have thread 0 and 1 disabled, which gets rid of the point)
SteamService (Manages random Steam stuff other than game launches so it should also be limited)
EpicWebHelper (the part of Epic Games Launcher that displays stuff, Epic Games Launcher itself needs all threads enabled, otherwise games started by it will also have thread 0 and 1 disabled, which gets rid of the point)
EACefSubProcess (the part of EA App that displays stuff, EA App itself needs all threads enabled, otherwise games started by it will also have thread 0 and 1 disabled, which gets rid of the point)
MicrosoftEdgeUpdate (Microsoft forces this to run whether you like Edge or not, might as well at least make it not waste cpu)
msedgewebview2 (Used for windows widgets and other web apps)
crossover (custom crosshair app)
x3 (mouse software for attackshark x3)
Virtual Desktop (Over the air PC VR)
Sunshine (remote desktop for gaming)
Spoolsv (Windows Print services)
SearchIndexer (Windows Search Indexing)
TailScale (Local VPN thing I use)

The script itself will also not mess with thread 0 and 1.
If an app is not found in the list, the script will ignore it and move to the next item.

There is a PowerShell version of the Script, and a Native exe. Here are the Pros/Cons

PowerShell Pros:
- This version of the script has existed for longer and is probably more stable.
PowerShell Cons:
- Uses a lot more memory
- Higher CPU Usage

Native Pros:
- Much less memory usage
- Much lower CPU Usage
Native Cons:
- Less testing done

DON'T RUN BOTH THE NATIVE AND THE POWERSHELL VERSION AT THE SAME TIME!
They're coded to do the same exact thing, running them both will either cause system instability or just provide no benefit whatsoever.
