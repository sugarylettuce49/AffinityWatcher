These scripts are designed to Disable Thread/CPU 0 and 1 for:
Medal and its encoder processes.
OBS and it's encoder processes.
Chrome

SteamWebHelper (the part of Steam that displays stuff, as Steam itself needs all threads enabled, otherwise games started by it will also have thread 0 and 1 disabled, which gets rid of the point)
SteamService (Manages random Steam stuff other than game launches so it should also be limited)
EpicWebHelper (the part of Epic Games Launcher that displays stuff, Epic Games Launcher itself needs all threads enabled, otherwise games started by it will also have thread 0 and 1 disabled, which gets rid of the point)
EACefSubProcess (the part of EA App that displays stuff, EA App itself needs all threads enabled, otherwise games started by it will also have thread 0 and 1 disabled, which gets rid of the point)
MicrosoftEdgeUpdate (Microsoft forces this to run whether you like Edge or not, might as well at least make it not waste cpu)

Virtual Desktop (Over the air PC VR)

The script itself will also not mess with thread 0 and 1.
If an app is not found in the list, the script will ignore it and move to the next item.

The script will also set process priority to "Below Normal" for most of these apps.

The script will create config files next to it, that you can edit, for example, to add apps that aren't listed here. Restart your pc for the new config to apply.
More instructions are found within the config files.




The PowerShell version of the script has been discontinued, and will no longer recieve updates, it will still be available for download. It is recommended to use the Native Version since it's proven to be stable, as well as providing much lower resource usage.
