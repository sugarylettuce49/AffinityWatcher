These scripts are designed to Disable Thread 0 for:
Medal and its encoder processes.
OBS and it's encoder processes.
Chrome
Discord
Spotify
SteamWebHelper (the part of Steam that displays stuff, as Steam itself needs all threads enabled, otherwise games started by Steam will also have thread 0 disabled, which gets rid of the point)
SteamService (Manages random Steam stuff other than game launches so it should also be limited)
EpicWebHelper (the part of Epic Games Launcher that displays stuff, Epic Games Launcher itself needs all threads enabled, otherwise games started by Epic Games Launcher will also have thread 0 disabled, which gets rid of the point)
MicrosoftEdgeUpdate (Microsoft forces this to run whether you like Edge or not, might as well at least make it not waste cpu)
msedgewebview2 (Used for windows widgets and other web apps)
TailScale (Local VPN thing I use, won't harm your PC if it doesn't see that task though)

The script itself will run on the last thread of your cpu, to make sure it also doesn't mess with thread 0.
