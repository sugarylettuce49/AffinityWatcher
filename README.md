#### I made this program because one day, I noticed as soon as I opened OBS, I had a ton of input delay and stutter in Fortnite, I decided to go into Task Manager and disable CPU0 for OBS. This fixed the input delay and FPS issue. Most guides say the other way around and would tell you to disable CPU0 for the game, but it never made sense to me, considering that for AMD cpus especially, CPU0 is the fastest one. Anyway, I made a script to automate this and used GPT to optimize it further. I also added some other programs that I think were problematic.

#### Finally I decided to make it public, so that more people don't have to deal with OBS, and other apps, constantly hogging the fastest CPU Thread.

#### Below is a link to a video tutorial, if either the script or the video were helpful, I'd really appriciate you leaving a like on the video!
